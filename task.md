Finish initial todos... 
Now in the best order, do the below:
Now all of these ideas are jumbled right now; rearrange them in the best order very detailed well arranged comprehensive plan possible to achieve this... Very important
Use Realtors_Practice.ico in the root folder as my web app favicon
The browser Title tab should read "Realtor's Practice Property Aggregation Platform" 
Saved search creation isn't working... some of the filters in the data explorer page don't work right.. The filter sidebar sould also be sticky on scroll, when I'm scrolling properties. Fix that too. check well with playwright mcp. Test each      
  filter and you'll see... Also maybe make me able to search with natural language for the properties and data explorer page (e.d 3 bedroom apartment in lekki under 100m) be very thorough in stuff like this.. he     
  search works nice but it's quite mid. The filters are very mid too. Creating saved searches don' t work too. In dashboard page, there's nothing under scrape activity. Some of the buttons in the ui don't match the  
  colour scheme. Some aren't even visible untile you hover (badfor ui). I'm not seeing anything under scrape results page anymore (why and fix it). Make sure and confirm to me that exports to csv and xlsx all work   
  right on all apages you can find them. Under settings page. I see disconnected from firestore. Fix this to work the right way... All the tabs in the settings page must be working right and correctly. There are     
  some settings in the global parameters section in advanced settings of the scraper control page that  should not be clickable or be set as default and not changeable e.g It should always be hadless. i only want    
  to be able to chnage max pages per site and geocoding. The rest should be permanent. I should be able to export as csv xlsx and json if i want and they all should be working right.  Once all of that is done. We will now do rigorous testings, look out for security vulnerabilities and fix them. I don't want my code exposed in anyway. You will then aggressively remove all unneccessary files from my codebase and on github. remove traces of ai from my github code, you can still stay in my local folder. You will do a comprehensive audit of my codebase. Optimize however you can. Use available tools you have like vercel, playwright and render mcp if meeded. Test as a normal regular human user would. I want us to be able to set env for all of our secrets and environments the ones needed for our app to run on the frontend and backend so that they are all configured right and i'll not need to be hardcoding. Create appropriate integrations for them on the frontend settings page and confierm that setting/adding them from there can work. 
  You will rearrange the code to be enterprise grade; all well properly formatted and structured and cleanly writtend essential documentations for relevant importatnt parts of the entire codebase... Remove unnecssary archives too. I want my codebase optimized and very neat.
I want to remove the continue as guest option. Access is only by logging in. create a page called /set-admin outside of the dashboard so that i can create admin details that can login my users to have access. Make sure before doing any of these auth page is already set up and configured working.  
  Before you start all these create a safepoint or maybe github branch where this existing code we have right now works and if all goes well; we;ll delete it later. But this will be a safeguard
